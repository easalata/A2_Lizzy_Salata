			<h2>Subtheme: Exploring Speculative Investment ("Flipped Properties")</h2>
			<ol>
				This dataset was used to create MAPC's report "Homes for Profit" in 2023. It contains residential sales 
				data strictly for the city of Boston from 2000 to 2023. The data encompasses 63 metrics including 
				categorizations such as type of property, zipcode, buying/ selling price, buying/ selling entity, and much 
				more.   
			</ol>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How does overall tennant satisfaction change when landlords switch to private equity firms?</li>
				<li>What percentage of properties are purchased with cash?</li>
				<li>How does the difference in price between house flips change relative to what type of entity is 
					purchasing and selling the property (i.e. bought and sold through speculation or not)?</li>
				<li>Which neighborhoods in the Greater Boston Area are being most affected by flipped properties?</li>
				<li>What types of entities are buying and selling these properties? (i.e. banks, individuals, LLC, etc.)</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			<ol>
				There is much to discover about this dataset, and an appropriate starting position for this project is to
				try and understand the scale of transactions, what types of properties are being bought and sold and at what 
				frequency, and how many properties are being 'flipped.'
			</ol>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/BuySide_PropertyType.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The image above is a bubble chart showing quantities of various types of properties that have been deemed to be 
				flipped properties based on buying side sales transactions. As this metric is speculatory, i.e. determined to be flipped
				if the buying price falls below the selling price by some threshold set by MAPC, I created a similar visualization of flipped
				properties from the sell side. This secondary visualization was nearly identical to the first, which provided consistency verification of 
				MAPC's algorithm to determine flipped status. I have purposefully excluded this secondary nearly identical representation to avoid repetition.
				One must use the usecode sheet of the metadata to determine the translations of the 
				property type class. The relevant usecodes displayed above translate as follows: Condominium (102), 1-Family Residence (101), 
				Apartment Building 4-8 Units (111), Office Building-General (340), Retail-Service (325), Apartment Building 9+ Units (112), 
				2 Family Residence (104), Office Condo Unit (343), and Mixed Use Primary Residence & Community (13). While it is true that property types
				discussed in the readings, such as condominiums and apartments are being flipped, there are other categories of properties being flipped as well.

				As an attempt to answer questions regarding which neighborhoods are being most impacted by flipped housing, it is first important to visualize
				all locations and types of housing included in the Boston data set. From the metadata, the 'Property Type' attribute condenses usecode and usage
				into larger umbrella categories, and thus provides an overview understanding of types of properties per location. Furthermore, in this particular 
				visualization, the view has been zoomed in to main Boston neighborhoods, and therefore, one should note that the few properties that are included 
				in the dataset but are located in more suburban areas have been excluded from view. There is significant representation of 'APT,' 'COM,' 'R1F,' and 
				'RCD.' Unfortunately, the metadata only translates a few of these labels (APT for apartment, CNR for condo, COM for commercial, and R1F for single 
				family residence), so it is unclear whether the types properties displayed match the properties described in the background readings.

				<img src="images/Buyers_Sellers.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The dataset includes many binary categorizations of types of entities buying and selling these properties. Clearly LLC's are dominating both buying and selling 
				these properties. One critique I have for this visualization
				is that both buyers and sellers are displayed in the same color. As I gain expertise in utilizing tableau, I hope to be able to control colors for ease 
				of distinguishing these two groups. Another critique of this visualization is that individuals who are not a part of these larger firms but did purchase 
				or sell properties are not included on this bar chart (i.e. the remaining catergory for when the property buyer/ seller is not an LLC, bank, etc.)
				</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Usecode_Price_Diff.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				With this visualization, I start to see some correlations in the data. In the first visualization, the largest bubble was property type 102 which translates 
				to condominium. Here we see another prevalent value in condominiums, this time in total price difference between selling and buying prices. This information 
				supports the testimonies from the background readings that condominiums are being greatly affected, and will drive some of the later analysis. 
				</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Cash_and_LLC_status.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This visualization attempts to capture additional details on the usecode '102,' condominium. Each circle represents a zipcode, and the size of the circle represents
				a summation of the number of units bought using cash. From the readings, one large advantage for potential buyers to secure a property is to pay with cash, however, it 
				is the case that usually only larger firms can afford to buy using this method. Since 'Buyer LLC' was the largest type of firm to buy properties, the orange shading of 
				the circles represents how many properties were bought by LLC's. Not surprisingly, there is a correlation between units bought with cash and units bought by LLC's. The largest
				and darkest circle is in the Back Bay neighborhood. While I have only lived in the greater Boston area for a few months, one cannot ignore the constant chatter of how this neighborhood
				is rapidly upgrading and expanding to attract higher paying residents.

				<img src="images/Avg_Sale_Price_Zipcode.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This visualization isolates greater Boston neighborhoods by zipcode color coded by average most recent sale price 'prslpr.' Two zipcodes were excluded, 02138 and 02190 due to distance from 
				the other neighborhoods. It matches my intuition and limited expertise of Boston that the downtown historic buildings sell for higher prices because of low supply and high demand. This 
				visualization leaves me with a few questions. What are the total sales per zipcode? What is the average square footage and price per square footage per zipcode? 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Flip_Status_Price_Diff.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The above figure displays the top 4 zipcodes for total counts of properties considered as flips based on MAPC's algorith of difference between buy and sell price. Additionally, the size of each circle
				displays the average of price difference percentage. In a similar map view, or by translating these zipcodes to neighborhoods, these are all prominant and popular neighborhoods in the greater Boston area.

				<img src="images/year_trends.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This image is attempting to take advantage of the long tenure of data that was collected in this data set. The 'RCD' property type is clearly dominating the types of properties being flipped. It is interesting to note 
				the steep downward trend in properties being flipped as we near present day which severely contrasts the housing activity from 2013 to 2019. Unfortunately, due to the lact of translating these property acronyms from the 
				metadata, it is difficult to confirm whether the properties most commonly being flipped are for residential purposes. 
				</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/buy_side_trend_llc.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This visualization juxtaposes two themes previously explored. First, I noticed that LLC's dominate the market in terms of buying properties. Second, properties considered flipped increased dramatically between 2010 and 2019.
				In this visualization we see a correlation of LLC activity with flipped properties which provides statistical evidence to the qualitative assesments described in the readings. This visualization as well as the previous make me question 
				why are flipped properties rapidly decreasing over the past few years? Of course we cannot ignore the impacts of the pandemic so this could be explored in later visualizations.
