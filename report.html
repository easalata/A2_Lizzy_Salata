			<h2>Subtheme: Exploring Speculative Investment ("Flipped Properties")</h2>
			<ol>
				This dataset was used to create MAPC's report "Homes for Profit" in 2023. It contains residential sales 
				data strictly for the city of Boston from 2000 to 2023. The data encompasses 63 metrics including 
				categorizations such as type of property, zipcode, buying/ selling price, buying/ selling entity, and much 
				more.   
			</ol>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How does overall tennant satisfaction change when landlords switch to private equity firms?</li>
				<li>What percentage of properties are purchased with cash?</li>
				<li>How does the difference in price between house flips change relative to what type of entity is 
					purchasing and selling the property (i.e. bought and sold through speculation or not)?</li>
				<li>Which neighborhoods in the Greater Boston Area are being most affected by flipped properties?</li>
				<li></li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			<ol>
				There is much to discover about this dataset, and an appropriate starting position for this project is to
				try and understand the scale of transactions, what types of properties are being bought and sold and at what 
				frequency, and how many properties are being 'flipped.'
			</ol>

				The image above is a bubble chart showing quantities of various types of properties that have been deemed to be 
				flipped properties based on buying side sales transactions. As this metric is speculatory, i.e. determined to be flipped
				if the buying price falls below the selling price by some threshold set by MAPC, I created a similar visualization of flipped
				properties from the sell side. This secondary visualization was nearly identical to the first, which provided consistency verification of 
				MAPC's algorithm to determine flipped status. I have purposefully excluded this secondary nearly identical representation to avoid repetition.
				One must use the usecode sheet of the metadata to determine the translations of the 
				property type class. The relevant usecodes displayed above translate as follows: Condominium (102), 1-Family Residence (101), 
				Apartment Building 4-8 Units (111), Office Building-General (340), Retail-Service (325), Apartment Building 9+ Units (112), 
				2 Family Residence (104), Office Condo Unit (343), and Mixed Use Primary Residence & Community (13). While it is true that property types
				discussed in the readings, such as condominiums and apartments are being flipped, there are other categories of properties being flipped as well.
